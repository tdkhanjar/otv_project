Arduino code for an engineering project from the fall of 2021. Functions are to manage sensors, positioning, and motion. The project was to build and automate a small rover to autonomously navigate a randomly-generated obstacle course while completing a task.
This specific robot was designed and programmed to test the material coating a large ball.
